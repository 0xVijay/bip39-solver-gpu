# BIP39 Mnemonic GPU Solver - Ethereum Edition

A high-performance BIP39 mnemonic phrase solver that uses GPU acceleration to find Ethereum wallet mnemonics matching specific constraints. Supports both standalone operation and distributed processing across multiple machines.

## Features

- **Complete BIP39 Support**: Uses the full 2048-word BIP39 dictionary with proper checksum validation
- **GPU Acceleration**: OpenCL-based GPU acceleration for faster searching (with CPU fallback)
- **Dynamic Word Constraints**: Configure word constraints via JSON (prefixes, specific words, positions)
- **Proper Cryptography**: BIP32/BIP44 derivation with PBKDF2 seed generation
- **Ethereum Address Derivation**: Proper Keccak-256 and secp256k1 implementation
- **Distributed Processing**: Scale across multiple machines with job server and worker clients
- **Slack Notifications**: Get notified when a matching mnemonic is found
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress reporting and rate monitoring
- **Checkpointing**: Fault-tolerant job management with automatic retry
- **Config-Driven**: Fully configurable via JSON files

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- OpenCL drivers and runtime (for GPU acceleration)
- GPU supporting OpenCL (optional - will fall back to CPU)

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xVijay/bip39-solver-gpu
cd bip39-solver-gpu
cargo build --release
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev pkg-config opencl-headers ocl-icd-opencl-dev

# macOS
brew install openssl pkg-config
```

## Usage

### Standalone Mode (Single Machine)

```bash
./target/release/bip39-solver-gpu --config config.json
# Or explicitly specify standalone mode:
./target/release/bip39-solver-gpu --config config.json --mode standalone
```

### Distributed Mode (Multiple Machines)

The distributed mode allows you to scale the search across multiple machines for faster processing.

#### 1. Setup Job Server

On the machine that will coordinate the work:

```bash
# Start the job server
./target/release/bip39-server --config distributed_config.json
```

The server will:
- Listen on port 3000 by default
- Divide the search space into jobs
- Distribute jobs to workers
- Track progress and handle failures
- Send notifications when solution is found

#### 2. Setup Worker Clients

On each worker machine:

```bash
# Start a worker (will automatically get unique ID)
./target/release/bip39-worker --config distributed_config.json

# Or specify custom worker ID
./target/release/bip39-worker --config distributed_config.json --worker-id worker-gpu-01
```

Workers will:
- Connect to the job server
- Request work assignments
- Process assigned ranges
- Report results back to server
- Automatically retry failed jobs

#### 3. Monitor Progress

Check server status via HTTP API:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer my-secret-key" http://localhost:3000/api/status
```

### Configuration

Create a `config.json` file with your search parameters:

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Word Space Generation** (`word_space.rs`)
   - Generates all possible mnemonic combinations from constraints
   - Uses complete 2048-word BIP39 dictionary
   - Validates BIP39 checksums

2. **Ethereum Address Derivation** (`eth.rs`)
   - Proper PBKDF2 seed generation from mnemonics
   - BIP32/BIP44 hierarchical key derivation
   - secp256k1 public key generation
   - Keccak-256 hashing for Ethereum addresses

3. **GPU Acceleration** (`gpu.rs`)
   - OpenCL kernel management
   - Batch processing on GPU
   - Graceful fallback to CPU

4. **Configuration System** (`config.rs`)
   - JSON-based configuration
   - Flexible word constraint specification
   - Validation and error handling

### Cryptographic Implementation

- **BIP39**: Complete word list with checksum validation
- **PBKDF2**: Proper seed derivation with 2048 iterations
- **BIP32**: Hierarchical deterministic key derivation
- **secp256k1**: Elliptic curve cryptography for key generation
- **Keccak-256**: Ethereum address hashing

## Performance

- **CPU**: Multi-threaded processing using Rayon (~17,800 mnemonics/sec with full BIP39 compliance)
- **GPU**: OpenCL acceleration for massive parallelization (when available)
- **Memory**: Efficient batch processing to minimize memory usage
- **Progress**: Real-time progress reporting and rate calculation

The current implementation processes approximately 17,800 mnemonics per second per core with complete BIP39 compliance. In distributed mode, you can scale linearly by adding more worker machines. For example:

- Single machine: ~17,800 mnemonics/sec
- 10 worker machines: ~178,000 mnemonics/sec  
- 100 worker machines: ~1,780,000 mnemonics/sec

GPU acceleration will significantly improve these rates when fully implemented.

## Technical Details

### Address Derivation Process

1. Generate BIP39 mnemonic from word constraints with checksum validation
2. Create seed using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 with "mnemonic" + passphrase (2048 iterations)
3. Derive master key using HMAC-SHA512 with "Bitcoin seed"
4. Follow BIP32/BIP44 derivation path for Ethereum (m/44'/60'/0'/0/0)
5. Generate public key using secp256k1
6. Hash public key with Keccak-256
7. Take last 20 bytes as Ethereum address

### REST API

The job server provides a REST API for monitoring and management:

#### Endpoints

- `GET /api/status` - Get server status and progress
- `POST /api/jobs/request` - Request a job (used by workers)
- `POST /api/jobs/complete` - Report job completion (used by workers)
- `POST /api/jobs/heartbeat` - Send worker heartbeat (used by workers)

#### Authentication

All requests require a Bearer token matching the secret in the configuration:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key" http://localhost:3000/api/status
```

#### Status Response Example

```json
{
  "total_jobs": 4194304,
  "pending_jobs": 1000000,
  "assigned_jobs": 10,
  "completed_jobs": 3194294,
  "failed_jobs": 0,
  "active_workers": 5,
  "total_combinations": 419430400000000000,
  "combinations_searched": 319429400000000000,
  "search_rate": 15000.0,
  "uptime_seconds": 3600,
  "solution_found": null
}
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
cargo test
```

Test GPU functionality specifically:

```bash
# Test GPU functionality (includes hardware detection and fallback)
cargo test testgpu -- --nocapture
```

Tests include:
- BIP39 word list completeness (2048 words)
- Checksum validation with known test vectors
- Address derivation with known mnemonics
- Configuration serialization/deserialization
- GPU initialization and processing (if available)
- Distributed job management
- Worker client functionality

## Known Test Vectors

The implementation is validated against standard BIP39 test vectors:

```
Mnemonic: abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about
Passphrase: ""
Expected: Deterministic Ethereum address generation

Mnemonic: legal winner thank year wave sausage worth useful legal winner thank yellow  
Passphrase: ""
Expected: Different deterministic address

Mnemonic: abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about
Passphrase: "TREZOR"
Expected: Different address due to passphrase
```

## Security Considerations

- **Private Keys**: Never log or store derived private keys
- **Mnemonics**: Handle found mnemonics securely
- **Memory**: Zero sensitive data after use
- **Network**: Secure communication for distributed processing
- **Legitimate Use**: This tool is for legitimate recovery purposes only

## Migration from Bitcoin

This is a migration of the original Bitcoin BIP39 solver. Key changes:

- **Complete BIP39 Implementation**: Full 2048-word dictionary with checksum validation
- **Proper Cryptography**: PBKDF2 + BIP32/BIP44 instead of simplified derivation
- **Ethereum Support**: Keccak-256 instead of double-SHA256 for address derivation
- **GPU Acceleration**: OpenCL integration for massive parallelization
- **Configuration-Driven**: JSON-based configuration instead of hardcoded values
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive test suite with known test vectors
