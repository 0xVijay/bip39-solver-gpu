# BIP39 Solver GPU - Ethereum Edition

This project iterates through possible BIP39 mnemonics to find those that generate a target Ethereum address. It has been migrated from the original Bitcoin implementation to support Ethereum wallet cracking using GPU acceleration.

## Features

- **Ethereum Support**: Derives Ethereum addresses using BIP44 derivation path `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`
- **GPU Acceleration**: Uses OpenCL for high-performance parallel processing (currently CPU fallback)
- **Distributed Processing**: Scale across multiple machines with job server and worker clients
- **Configurable Constraints**: Specify known word prefixes or exact words for any mnemonic position
- **Slack Notifications**: Get notified when a matching mnemonic is found
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress reporting and rate monitoring
- **Checkpointing**: Fault-tolerant job management with automatic retry

## Configuration

The tool uses a JSON configuration file instead of command-line flags. Run without arguments to see a sample configuration:

```bash
./bip39-solver-gpu --config config.json
```

### Sample Configuration

```json
{
  "word_constraints": [
    {
      "position": 0,
      "prefix": "aban",
      "words": []
    },
    {
      "position": 11,
      "prefix": null,
      "words": ["abandon", "ability", "about"]
    }
  ],

    "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK",
    "channel": "#notifications"
  },

## Usage

### Standalone Mode (Single Machine)

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install libssl-dev pkg-config opencl-headers ocl-icd-opencl-dev
   
   # macOS
   brew install openssl pkg-config
   ```

2. **Build**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Create Configuration**: 
   ```bash
   # Generate sample config
   ./target/release/bip39-solver-gpu --config config.json
   # Edit config.json with your target address and constraints
   ```

4. **Run Standalone**:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/bip39-solver-gpu --config config.json --mode standalone
   # Or simply (standalone is default):
   ./target/release/bip39-solver-gpu --config config.json
   ```

### Distributed Mode (Multiple Machines)

The distributed mode allows you to scale the search across multiple machines for faster processing.

#### 1. Setup Job Server

On the machine that will coordinate the work:

```bash
# Start the job server
./target/release/bip39-server --config distributed_config.json
```

The server will:
- Listen on port 3000 by default
- Divide the search space into jobs
- Distribute jobs to workers
- Track progress and handle failures
- Send notifications when solution is found

#### 2. Setup Worker Clients

On each worker machine:

```bash
# Start a worker (will automatically get unique ID)
./target/release/bip39-worker --config distributed_config.json

# Or specify custom worker ID
./target/release/bip39-worker --config distributed_config.json --worker-id worker-gpu-01
```

Workers will:
- Connect to the job server
- Request work assignments
- Process assigned ranges
- Report results back to server
- Automatically retry failed jobs

#### 3. Monitor Progress

Check server status via HTTP API:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer my-secret-key" http://localhost:3000/api/status
```

#### 4. Distributed Configuration

Make sure your `distributed_config.json` includes the worker section:

```json
{
  "word_constraints": [...],
  "ethereum": {...},
  "slack": {...},
  "worker": {
    "server_url": "http://your-server-ip:3000",
    "secret": "your-shared-secret-key"
  },
  "batch_size": 100000,
  "passphrase": ""
}
```

### Distributed Mode Example

**Server Output:**
```

**Worker Output:**

```

## Performance

The current CPU implementation processes approximately 2,500-3,000 mnemonics per second per core. In distributed mode, you can scale linearly by adding more worker machines. For example:

- Single machine: ~3,000 mnemonics/sec
- 10 worker machines: ~30,000 mnemonics/sec  
- 100 worker machines: ~300,000 mnemonics/sec

GPU acceleration will significantly improve these rates when fully implemented.

## Technical Details

### Address Derivation Process

1. Generate BIP39 mnemonic from word constraints
2. Create seed using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 with "mnemonic" + passphrase
3. Derive master key using HMAC-SHA512 with "Bitcoin seed"
4. Follow BIP44 derivation path for Ethereum (m/44'/60'/0'/0/0)
5. Generate public key using secp256k1
6. Hash public key with Keccak-256
7. Take last 20 bytes as Ethereum address

### Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

```bash
cargo test
```

Tests include:
- Known mnemonic to address derivation
- Address validation and comparison
- Configuration serialization
- Word space constraint handling
- Distributed job management
- Worker client functionality

### REST API

The job server provides a REST API for monitoring and management:

#### Endpoints

- `GET /api/status` - Get server status and progress
- `POST /api/jobs/request` - Request a job (used by workers)
- `POST /api/jobs/complete` - Report job completion (used by workers)
- `POST /api/jobs/heartbeat` - Send worker heartbeat (used by workers)

#### Authentication

All requests require a Bearer token matching the secret in the configuration:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key" http://localhost:3000/api/status
```

#### Status Response Example

```json
{
  "total_jobs": 4194304,
  "pending_jobs": 1000000,
  "assigned_jobs": 10,
  "completed_jobs": 3194294,
  "failed_jobs": 0,
  "active_workers": 5,
  "total_combinations": 419430400000000000,
  "combinations_searched": 319429400000000000,
  "search_rate": 15000.0,
  "uptime_seconds": 3600,
  "solution_found": null
}
```

## Security Considerations

- This tool is for legitimate recovery purposes only
- Never use on wallets that don't belong to you
- The search space for unrestricted mnemonics is computationally infeasible
- Always verify recovered mnemonics independently

- Updated from Bitcoin address format to Ethereum address format
- Changed from BIP44 Bitcoin path to Ethereum path
- Added configuration file support
- Replaced hardcoded values with configurable options
