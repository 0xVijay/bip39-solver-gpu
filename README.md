# BIP39 Solver GPU - Ethereum Edition

This project iterates through possible BIP39 mnemonics to find those that generate a target Ethereum address. It has been migrated from the original Bitcoin implementation to support Ethereum wallet cracking using GPU acceleration.

## Features

- **Ethereum Support**: Derives Ethereum addresses using BIP44 derivation path `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`
- **Multi-GPU Support**: Supports both OpenCL and CUDA backends with multi-GPU processing
- **Modular GPU Backends**: Pluggable architecture for OpenCL and CUDA acceleration
- **Distributed Processing**: Scale across multiple machines with job server and worker clients
- **Configurable Constraints**: Specify known word prefixes or exact words for any mnemonic position
- **Slack Notifications**: Get notified when a matching mnemonic is found
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress reporting and rate monitoring
- **Checkpointing**: Fault-tolerant job management with automatic retry

## Configuration

The tool uses a JSON configuration file instead of command-line flags. Run without arguments to see a sample configuration:

```bash

## Usage

### Standalone Mode (Single Machine)

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install libssl-dev pkg-config opencl-headers ocl-icd-opencl-dev
   
   # macOS
   brew install openssl pkg-config
   ```

2. **Build**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Create Configuration**: 
   ```bash
   # Generate sample config
   ./target/release/bip39-solver-gpu --config config.json
   # Edit config.json with your target address and constraints
   ```

4. **Run Standalone**:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/bip39-solver-gpu --config config.json --mode standalone
   # Or simply (standalone is default):
   ./target/release/bip39-solver-gpu --config config.json
   
   # Use specific GPU backend:
   ./target/release/bip39-solver-gpu --config config.json --gpu-backend cuda
   
   # Use specific GPU devices:
   ./target/release/bip39-solver-gpu --config config.json --gpu-device 0 --gpu-device 1
   
   # Enable multi-GPU processing:
   ./target/release/bip39-solver-gpu --config config.json --multi-gpu
   ```

### GPU Backend Configuration

The tool supports multiple GPU backends for acceleration:

#### OpenCL Backend (Default)
- Supports most GPU vendors (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)
- Falls back to CPU processing if no OpenCL devices available
- Good compatibility across different systems

#### CUDA Backend
- Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- Currently in development (stub implementation)
- Will provide better performance on supported hardware

#### Multi-GPU Support
Enable multi-GPU processing to scale across multiple devices:

```bash
# Use all available GPU devices
./target/release/bip39-solver-gpu --config config.json --multi-gpu

# Use specific devices only
./target/release/bip39-solver-gpu --config config.json --gpu-device 0 --gpu-device 2 --multi-gpu

# Force CUDA backend (when available)
./target/release/bip39-solver-gpu --config config.json --gpu-backend cuda --multi-gpu
```

#### GPU Configuration Examples

```json
{
  "gpu": {
    "backend": "opencl",
    "devices": [],         // Empty = use all available
    "multi_gpu": true
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "gpu": {
    "backend": "cuda", 
    "devices": [0, 1],     // Use specific GPU devices
    "multi_gpu": true
  }
}
```

### Distributed Mode (Multiple Machines)

The distributed mode allows you to scale the search across multiple machines for faster processing.

#### 1. Setup Job Server

On the machine that will coordinate the work:

```bash
# Start the job server
./target/release/bip39-server --config distributed_config.json
```

The server will:
- Listen on port 3000 by default
- Divide the search space into jobs
- Distribute jobs to workers
- Track progress and handle failures
- Send notifications when solution is found

#### 2. Setup Worker Clients

On each worker machine:

```bash
# Start a worker (will automatically get unique ID)
./target/release/bip39-worker --config distributed_config.json

# Or specify custom worker ID
./target/release/bip39-worker --config distributed_config.json --worker-id worker-gpu-01
```

Workers will:
- Connect to the job server
- Request work assignments
- Process assigned ranges
- Report results back to server
- Automatically retry failed jobs

#### 3. Monitor Progress

Check server status via HTTP API:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer my-secret-key" http://localhost:3000/api/status
```

#### 4. Distributed Configuration

Make sure your `distributed_config.json` includes the worker section:

```json
{
  "word_constraints": [...],
  "ethereum": {...},
  "slack": {...},
  "worker": {
    "server_url": "http://your-server-ip:3000",
    "secret": "your-shared-secret-key"
  },
  "batch_size": 100000,
  "passphrase": ""
}
```

### Distributed Mode Example

**Server Output:**
```

```

## Performance

The performance varies significantly based on the processing backend:

### CPU Processing
- Single machine: ~3,000 mnemonics/sec (baseline)
- 10 worker machines: ~30,000 mnemonics/sec  
- 100 worker machines: ~300,000 mnemonics/sec

### GPU Processing (When Fully Implemented)
- Single OpenCL device: ~50,000-100,000 mnemonics/sec (estimated)
- Single CUDA device: ~100,000-200,000 mnemonics/sec (estimated)
- Multi-GPU setup (4 devices): ~400,000-800,000 mnemonics/sec (estimated)

### Current Status
- OpenCL backend currently falls back to CPU processing
- CUDA backend is in development (stub implementation)
- Multi-GPU coordination infrastructure is in place
- Full GPU acceleration will be available in future releases

Distributed mode with multiple worker machines can scale linearly regardless of the backend used.

## Technical Details

### Address Derivation Process

1. Generate BIP39 mnemonic from word constraints
2. Create seed using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 with "mnemonic" + passphrase
3. Derive master key using HMAC-SHA512 with "Bitcoin seed"
4. Follow BIP44 derivation path for Ethereum (m/44'/60'/0'/0/0)
5. Generate public key using secp256k1
6. Hash public key with Keccak-256
7. Take last 20 bytes as Ethereum address

### Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

```bash
cargo test
```

Tests include:
- Known mnemonic to address derivation
- Address validation and comparison
- Configuration serialization
- Word space constraint handling
- Distributed job management
- Worker client functionality

### REST API

The job server provides a REST API for monitoring and management:

#### Endpoints

- `GET /api/status` - Get server status and progress
- `POST /api/jobs/request` - Request a job (used by workers)
- `POST /api/jobs/complete` - Report job completion (used by workers)
- `POST /api/jobs/heartbeat` - Send worker heartbeat (used by workers)

#### Authentication

All requests require a Bearer token matching the secret in the configuration:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key" http://localhost:3000/api/status
```

#### Status Response Example

```json
{
  "total_jobs": 4194304,
  "pending_jobs": 1000000,
  "assigned_jobs": 10,
  "completed_jobs": 3194294,
  "failed_jobs": 0,
  "active_workers": 5,
  "total_combinations": 419430400000000000,
  "combinations_searched": 319429400000000000,
  "search_rate": 15000.0,
  "uptime_seconds": 3600,
  "solution_found": null
}
```

## Security Considerations

- This tool is for legitimate recovery purposes only
- Never use on wallets that don't belong to you
- The search space for unrestricted mnemonics is computationally infeasible
- Always verify recovered mnemonics independently

- Changed from BIP44 Bitcoin path to Ethereum path
- Added configuration file support
- Replaced hardcoded values with configurable options
